# Repeated-String--Algo

This C++ code sets up a solution for the Repeated String problem, where given a string s and a number n, the goal is to find how many times the character 'a' appears in the first n characters of the infinitely repeated string s. The main function reads the input string and the number n, trims whitespace, converts n to a long integer, and calls the repeatedString function (which is yet to be implemented) to compute the result. The final count is then written to an output file.
